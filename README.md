Weather App

A simple weather app using Visual Crossing API (project courtesy of The Odin Project)

Using the search bar, User's can type in a desired location (defaulted to Sacramento). Upon submitting the location, the app generate basic info about the weather in that location provided by Visual Crossing API. Data includes current temp, min and max temp, small description of current weather status, and temperature info throughout the day and future days. 

The main goal of this app was to learn to use an API and display relevant data correctly. Once I learned how to gather the correct data, the rest came pretty easily. Outside of the basic functionality of showing a given temperature at the time, I chose to add a bit more data which may be relevant to users, as well as dynamic background changes and icons. As of now, background/icon images are limited to rain/clouds/clear weather conditions as my way of displaying them relied on how the API describes wheather conditions, which could vary a lot between all of the different types of weather terminology.

While basic, I feel satisfied with the project given its purpose. While there could be more ways to polish and improve the app, they are very low priority and wouldn't impact the main functionality.
